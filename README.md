# mega_hub75_boardtes
Test code to excercise the hardware on my Mega Hub 75 (take 2) board.
Outputs Pot and all 3 outputs from the sound board out serial.
Graphs the audio output on our RGB matrix.

Lessons learned:
* Pay attention to the usb and power jacks on the template!!!  For this board, the pot is right above the USB jack, which means the board doesn't quite sandwich right, and if those pot connectors touch the USB, it shorts the middle pot pin with Power.  Not a good thing...
* I want to silkscreen the Mega Jumpers with their designators
* a custom silkscreeen would be cool...
